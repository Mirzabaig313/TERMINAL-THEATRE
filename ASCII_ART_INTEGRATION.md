## Technical Details

### Implementation Pattern
Each scene with ASCII art follows this pattern:
```python
self.scenes["scene_name"] = Scene(
    id="scene_name",
    description="...",
    ascii_art=AnimationLibrary.method_name(),  # Static ASCII art
    animation=AnimationLibrary.animation_name(),  # Optional animation
    dialogue=[...],
    choices=[...]
)
```

### Color Support
All ASCII art methods support a `colored=True/False` parameter:
- `colored=True` - Returns Rich Text object with styling
- `colored=False` - Returns plain string

### ASCII Art Locations Match Story
The ASCII art pieces were specifically designed for Blood and Neon locations:
- Tarot cards for the ritualistic murder investigation
- Crime scenes for murder locations (Pier Nineteen, etc.)
- Laboratory for Ouroboros Pharma pharmaceutical facility
- Nightclub for The Crimson Hour Club
- Police station for Detective Kane's office
- Syringe for Nightshade compound
- Morgue for Dr. Cross's workplace
- Ouroboros symbol for the conspiracy reveal
