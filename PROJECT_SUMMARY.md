## 🧪 Testing

All automated tests pass:
- ✅ Story structure validation
- ✅ Game state management
- ✅ Scene branching logic
- ✅ Endings verification
- ✅ Renderer functionality
- ✅ Animation library

## 🚀 How to Run

### Play the Game
```bash
python3 main.py
```

### Run Tests
```bash
python3 test_game.py
```

### Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- No external dependencies
- Cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux)

## 📝 Documentation

Three levels of documentation provided:

1. **README.md**: Comprehensive guide
   - Full feature list
   - How to play
   - Developer guide
   - Story creation tutorial

2. **QUICKSTART.md**: Quick reference
   - Immediate instructions
   - Tips for first playthrough
   - Common paths through story

3. **In-code documentation**: 
   - Docstrings for all modules
   - Type hints for clarity
   - Comments where needed

## 🎯 Design Decisions

### Why Python?
- Excellent terminal handling with standard library
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Easy to read and modify
- No dependency management needed

### Why No External Libraries?
- Simplicity - anyone can run it immediately
- Portability - works everywhere Python works
- Learning - shows pure Python capabilities

### Story Design Philosophy
